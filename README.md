# Chart-fltkhs
FLTKHS backend for the Chart Haskell library. 

First working version of the charts. 

Buids the library and the examples, which resemble the examples from https://github.com/timbod7/haskell-chart/wiki. 

What will not work is charts with transparency, (e.g. Examples8, 9 and 10 from the Chart library), as FLTK does not support transparency in it's primitive drawing functions.
